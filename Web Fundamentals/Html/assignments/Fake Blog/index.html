        <p>Beyonce Knowles was born September 4, 1981)[2] is an American singer, songwriter and actress.
            Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child.
            Beyoncé rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of the R&B girl-group Destiny's Child.
            Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups in history.
            Their hiatus saw Beyoncé's theatrical film debut in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and the release of her debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003).
            The album established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards, and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy".
        </p>
        <p>Following the break-up of Destiny's Child in 2006, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained the top ten singles "Déjà Vu", "Irreplaceable", and "Beautiful Liar".
            Beyoncé also continued her acting career, with starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), and Obsessed (2009).
            Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the introduction of her
            alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".
            Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul.
            Her critically acclaimed fifth album, Beyoncé (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes. Her sixth album, Lemonade (2016),
            also received widespread critical acclaim, and subsequently became the best-selling album of 2016.
